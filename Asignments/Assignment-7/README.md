The layout is used to enhance the look and feel of the application. 
To arrange the components in a container, the various layout classes can be used such as Flow layout and Border Layout.
Some important layouts:
Flow Layout
Border Layout
Grid Layout
Box Layout

1.Flow Layout
 
It places components in a sequence one after the other component on a row.
By default, the components are aligned in the center and are placed from left to right and from top to bottom.

2.Border Layout
 
Border Layout divides the container into five regions: North, south, East, West, Center.
Each region can contain only a single component. 
Border Layout arranges and resizes the component to place them in the five regions.

3.Grid Layout
 
GridLayout divides the container into rows and columns.
The intersection of the row and the column is called a cell. The cell can contain only one component.

4.Box Layout
 
BoxLayout arranges multiple components either vertically,
such as a stack, or horizontally, such as a row.
